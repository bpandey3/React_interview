•	<b>What are React Hooks and how do you use them? </b> 
 React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Examples include useState for state management, useEffect for side effects, and useContext for context API.

•	<b>Explain the difference between state and props? </b> 
State is a local data storage that is local to the component and cannot be passed to other components. Props are used to pass data from one component to another.


•	<b>What is the Virtual DOM and how does it work? </b> 
 The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to figure out what changes need to be made to the real DOM, making updates more efficient.

•	<b>How do you handle state management in React? </b> 
 State management in React can be handled using local component state, the Context API, or state management libraries like Redux, MobX, or Recoil.


•	<b>What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and how do you use them? </b> 
 HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props. They are used for cross-cutting concerns like logging, access control, or data fetching.

•	<b>Explain the concept of component lifecycle methods? </b> \n Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that get called at different stages of a component's life (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).


•	<b>What is the Context API and when should you use it? </b> 
 The Context API is a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It’s useful for global statelike theme or user authentication.

•	<b>How do you optimize React application performance? </b> 
 Optimization techniques include memoization using React.memo, lazy loading with React.lazy, code splitting, and optimizing rendering with useMemo and useCallback.

•	<b>What are some common pitfalls in React development and how do you avoid them? </b> 
 Common pitfalls include improper state management, excessive re-renders, and inefficient API calls. Avoid these by using hooks correctly, optimizing performance, and managing state effectively.

•	<b>Explain the difference between class components and functional components? </b> \n Class components use ES6 classes and lifecycle methods, while functional components are simpler and use hooks for state and lifecycle management.

•	<b>What is prop drilling and how can you avoid it? </b> 
 Prop drilling is the process of passing props down multiple levels in a component tree. You can avoid it by using the Context API or state management libraries.


•	<b>How do you implement code splitting in a React application? </b> 
 Code splitting can be implemented using dynamic import() and React’s lazy() and Suspense components to load parts of the application on demand.

•	<b>What are some best practices for testing React applications? </b> 
 Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Ensure you test components in isolation and in the context of the entire application.


•	<b>Explain the concept of lazy loading in React? </b> \n Lazy loading is the practice of loading parts of an application only when they are needed. This can be achieved using React.lazy and Suspense to dynamically import components.

•	<b>What are some advanced techniques for managing state in large applications? </b> 
 Advanced techniques include using Redux or MobX for predictable state management, Context API for global state, and splitting state management logic into custom hooks.


•	<b>How do you handle side effects in React? </b> 
 Side effects in React are handled using the useEffect hook, which allows you to perform actions like data fetching, subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM.

•	<b>What are some common patterns for organizing React projects? </b> 
 Common patterns include separating components by feature or functionality, using containers and presentational components, and adhering to a consistent folder structure.


•	<b>Explain the concept of server-side rendering in React? </b> \n Server-side rendering (SSR) involves rendering React components on the server and sending the HTML to the client. It improves performance and SEO. Tools like Next.js facilitate SSR.

•	<b>What are some security best practices for React applications? </b> 
 Security best practices include sanitizing user inputs, using HTTPS, implementing proper authentication and authorization, avoiding inline styles, and keeping dependencies up to date.


•	<b>How do you use React with TypeScript? </b> 
 React with TypeScript involves using TypeScript to add static typing to your React code. This improves code quality and maintainability by catching errors at compile-time.
